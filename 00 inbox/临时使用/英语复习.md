## Connection or conversation

1 On a quiet Saturday afternoon, Paul and his wife Maria are sitting at home reading their favorite books. Opposite to where they sit are their two sons: 15-year-old Jason and 12-year-old Jack, absorbed in playing chess. What's the scenario here? The family calls it their "offline day". From Friday night through Sunday evening, there are no video games, no computers, and no cell phones. 

2 In our "always on" lives, such a scenario of family convention seems gone. Are we too immersed in the brilliance of the digital world? Perhaps. We cannot seem to resist the lure of our cell phones, even when we are in the company of others. Apparently, we have sacrificed conversation for connection. 

3 At home, families sit together, texting, and reading emails. At work, executives text during board meetings. We also text when we're on dates. Walking through a college library or the campus of a high-tech company, one sees an identical scenario: People are together, but each of them is in their own bubble, furiously connected to keyboards and tiny touch screens. The little devices most of us carry around are so powerful that they change not only what we do but also who we are. 

4 It's true we've already become accustomed to a new way of being "alone together". Technology-enabled, we are able to be with one another, and also elsewhere, connected to wherever we want to be. We've been used to the idea of being in a tribe of one, loyal to our own party. In the silence of connection, we are comforted by being in touch with "invisible" friends and significant others, not too close, nor too far, just right. 

5 A senior partner at a law firm describes vividly a scene in his office. Every morning, young associates would first lay out their suite of technologies: laptops, tablets, and multiple phones. Then they would put their earphones on. "Big ones. Like pilots. They have converted their desks into cockpits," he said. With the young lawyers sitting in their cockpits, the office becomes quiet, a quiet that does not ask to be broken. They have completely plunged into their virtual world. 

6 As we can see, there is no limit to time and space in this digital world. Connection can be anytime and anywhere. Gradually, we've picked up a habit of deletion – wiping out rich human relationships. The move from conversation to connection, for example, is part of this. In fact, online connection is often a deceptive illusion in which we cheat ourselves, assuming we're not alone. Worse, over time we'll stop caring and forget there is a difference between online connection and face-to-face conversation. 

7 We are tempted to think that our little "sips" of online connection add up to a big swallow of real conversation. No, they don't. Even though all of these sips have their places – in politics, commerce, romance, and friendship, I would claim, no matter how valuable they are, it's impossible for them to substitute for real conversation, where people exchange ideas and share viewpoints dynamically. 

8 Yes, connecting in sips may work for gathering discrete bits of information, or for saying "I am thinking about you", or even for saying "I love you", but it's far from the adequacy of communication when it comes to understanding and knowing one another. Real conversation, on the other hand, is a more informative process, in which we're more caring and observant. We hesitate and pause and go silent, and we reveal ourselves to one another through tones and nuances. 

9 While communicating on our digital devices, we unconsciously raise our expectations as well. As we increase the volume and velocity of online connection, we start to expect acceleration – faster answers. We ask one another simpler questions; we dumb down our communication, even on the most important matters. Face-to-face conversation, by contrast, unfolds slowly, so it teaches us patience. 

10 In addition, our move from conversation means diminished opportunities to learn skills of self-reflection. These days, social media continually asks us what's "on our mind", but we have little motivation to say something truly self-reflective. Imagine how hard it is to do something with thousands of online friends! It is through the conversation with trusted others that we learn to converse with ourselves – to be honest with ourselves. 

11 I'm not a critic, but I am a partisan for conversation. To make room for it, I see some first steps. At home, we can create "sacred" spaces for conversation while doing domestic chores: the kitchen, the dining room. We can make our cars a place free of little devices. We can be a consultant to our children through the demonstration of the value of conversation. At work, we can do the same thing. Employees asked for casual Fridays; managers may "collaborate" and introduce conversational Thursdays. 

12 Although an "offline day" may be unbearable for tech enthusiasts who need to alter their habits, experts say it is beneficial to assess both the merit and burden of digital technology. Let's take some time away from the beeps and rings to evaluate our relationship with technology. Try to make some changes. At the beginning, it might be hard, but after a few months when a habit forms, we'll begin to realize we have already gained a lot from it. So, look up, look at one another, and let's start a conversation.

## Zheng He, the great ancient Chinese explorer

1 In 1999, an American journalist reported a surprising encounter on a tiny African island called Pate, just off the coast of Kenya. There, in a village of stone huts set amongst dense trees, the journalist met a number of elderly men who told him that they were descendants of Chinese sailors, shipwrecked on Pate several centuries ago. Their ancestors had traded with the local Africans, who had given them giraffes to take back to China; then their boat was driven onto the nearby reef. He noted many clues that seemed to confirm the islanders' tale, including their vaguely Asian appearance, the antique porcelain heirlooms in their homes, and the porcelain shards on the beaches. Evidently, this remote African village retains an echo of one of history's most astonishing episodes of maritime exploration. 

2 About six centuries ago, a mighty fleet of Chinese ships ventured west to the Indian Ocean, reaching Ceylon, Arabia, and East Africa. The fleet included giant nine-masted junks escorted by dozens of supply ships, water tankers, transports for cavalry horses, and patrol boats. The fleet's crew totaled more than 27,000 sailors and soldiers. As a comparison, Columbus' largest crew was of only about 1,500 people and the _Santa María_, the largest ship for his first voyage, was much smaller than Zheng He's largest junk. 

3 Seven times, from 1405 to 1433, the Chinese fleet set off for the unknown. These great expeditions took place about half a century before the first Europeans, rounding the tip of Africa in frail Portuguese caravels, "discovered" the Indian Ocean. The seven expeditions were all led by one man, Zheng He, one of the greatest explorers in Chinese history. 

4 Zheng He was born around 1371 in Yunnan, southwestern China. As a child, he was very curious about the world. He often asked his father and grandfather, who had been to distant places, questions about their journey, along with the people and places they encountered. From a young age, he started reading books by great scholars, such as Confucius and Mencius. Later when he served in the royal court, he received military training and became a trusted assistant and adviser to the emperor. He was also in charge of palace construction and repairs, learned more about weapons, and became more knowledgeable in ship construction. 

5 In 1403, the emperor commanded the construction of the Treasure Fleet. Both the treasure ships and the support vessels – battleships and boats carrying grain and horses – featured divided hulls with several watertight compartments. This engineering innovation had roots in early Chinese seafaring. It allowed mariners to take unprecedented amounts of drinking water on long voyages, while also adding much-needed ballast, balance, and stability. 

6 In 1405, the emperor appointed Zheng He to head a massive fleet of more than 200 junks with a royal order to establish ties with rulers all around the Indian Ocean. It was the start of the seven great voyages of the Treasure Fleet. The junks, loaded with Chinese silk, porcelain, and lacquerware, visited ports around the Indian Ocean, where Zheng He exchanged the goods for spices, ivory, medicines, rare wood, pearls, and exotic animals, sought by the Ming court. 

7 During his career as a naval commander, Zheng He negotiated trade pacts, fought pirates, and brought back gifts to China. He and his crew traveled and traded not only with the cities in what are now Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and India, but also with the Arabian ports of modern-day Yemen and Saudi Arabia. The rulers he encountered there were impressed by his diplomatic skills and the elaborate gifts he brought them. They agreed to send ambassadors to the Ming court. 

8 In 1431, Zheng He set out with his fleet for the seventh expedition around the Indian Ocean, sailing all the way to Malindi on Kenya's east coast and stopping at trading ports along the way. Toward the end of this voyage in 1433, Zheng He died of disease. 

9 Zheng He had helped spread the culture and influence of China over a vast realm. But the war in the north then drew military investment away from the maintenance of the fleet and the royal court turned its focus to the construction and expansion of the Great Wall. Inevitably, the navy shrank and all the larger classes of ships were destroyed. This contributed to the end of the epic time of the Ming Dynasty sea voyages. 

10 Zheng He spent years at sea sailing between China and the east coast of Africa, setting up diplomatic relationships that would reshape Asian life. His seven expeditions challenged what humans could do at sea, pushing the limits of their boats' size, complexity, and capacity for long-distance travel. They were also essential to the spread of two Chinese technologies that helped build our modern world: gunpowder and the compass. 

11 Today, whether people view Zheng He as an emblem of Chinese diplomacy or as a symbol of the country's spirit of adventure and bravery, one thing is for certain: Zheng He remains one of the greatest explorers in world history, and the voyages he led stand among the great wonders in the history of ocean navigation, contributing significantly to the progress of human civilization.

## The surprising purpose of travel

1 It's 4:15 in the morning, and my alarm clock has just stolen away a lovely dream. I almost go back to sleep before my eye catches my packed suitcase and I groan, remembering that I'm going to the airport. The taxi is late and then lost, and I'm getting increasingly nervous that I'll miss my flight. I run in when we arrive, stagger through security, and finally get to my gate. After all the trouble of this morning, my flight is canceled and I'm stuck in this terminal for the next 218 minutes, and my only consolation is a cup of complimentary airport coffee. This is traveling, a burdensome series of running and waiting, and after countless hours, finally getting there. 

2 Why do we travel? I don't mind the actual flying, the wonder of being airborne in a dense metal bird. The rest of the journey, however, can feel like a tedious lesson in the ills of modernity, from the predawn x-ray screening to the sad airport malls selling clusters of keepsakes. 

3 Sometimes, of course, we travel because we need to. Because in this digital age, there is still something important about the handshake at a business luncheon. Or eating Mom's special food on Thanksgiving. Or seeing your girlfriend on your two-year anniversary. 

4 But most travel is decidedly optional. Only corporate travel, about 30 percent of trips over 50 miles, is truly compulsory. In most cases, we travel because we want to, because the annoyances of the airport are offset by the thrill of being someplace new. Because work is stressful and our blood pressure is too high and we need a vacation somewhere tropical. Because home is boring. Because the flights are on sale. Because Paris is Paris. 

5 Travel, in other words, is a basic human desire. But do we travel just for fun? I'm afraid not. Actually, getting away is an essential habit of effective thinking. Thanks to modern aviation, we can now move through space at an inhuman speed. For the first time in human history, we can outrun the sun and move from one hemisphere to another in a single day. Of course, it's not enough to simply get on a plane. If we want to realize the creative benefits of travel, then we have to rethink its overall purpose. Most people, after all, escape to Paris so they don't have to think about those troubles they left behind. But here's the irony: Our mind is most likely to solve our most stubborn problems while we are sitting in a Left Bank café. So, instead of contemplating that buttery dessert, we should be conscious of those domestic issues we just can't solve. 

6 The larger lesson, though, is that our thoughts are saturated with the familiar. The brain is a space of near-infinite possibility, which means that it spends a lot of time and energy choosing what not to notice. As a result, creativity is traded away for efficiency; we think in finite, literal prose, not symbolic verse. A bit of distance, however, helps loosen the cognitive chains that imprison us, making it easier to mingle the new with the old; the mundane is grasped from a slightly more abstract perspective. According to research, the experience of an exotic culture endows us with a valuable open-mindedness, making it easier to realize that even a trivial thing can have multiple meanings. Take head movement, which is commonly used to communicate positive versus negative response, as an example. In most cultures, nodding one's head denotes positivity, meaning "yes", and shaking the head is associated with negativity, meaning "no". In Bulgaria, however, this response pattern is reversed – that is, head shaking means "yes" and head nodding means "no". 

7 Such cultural contrasts mean that seasoned travelers are open to ambiguity, willing to realize that there are decidedly different (and equally valid) ways of interpreting the world. This, in turn, allows them to expand the circumference of their "cognitive inputs" as they refuse to settle for their first answers and initial guesses. 

8 Of course, this mental flexibility doesn't come from mere distance, a simple change in latitude and longitude. Instead, this renaissance of creativity appears to be a side effect of difference: We need to change cultures, to experience the disorienting diversity of human traditions. The same facets of foreign travel that are so confusing (Do I tip the waiter? Where is this train taking me?) turn out to have a lasting impact, making us more creative because we're less insular. We're reminded of all that we don't know, which is nearly everything; we're surprised by the constant stream of surprises. Even in this globalized age, we can still be amazed at all the earthly things that weren't included in the guidebooks and that certainly don't exist back home. 

9 So, let's not pretend that travel doesn't have its drawbacks, or that we endure jet lag for pleasure. We don't spend 10 hours lost in the Louvre because we like it, and the view from the top of Machu Picchu probably doesn't make up for the trouble of lost luggage. (More often than not, I need a vacation after my vacation.) We travel because we need to, because distance and difference are the secret cornerstones of creativity. When we get home, home is still the same. But something in our mind has been changed, and that changes everything.

## Will you be a worker or a laborer?

1 To be truly happy, a person must feel both free and important. People are never happy if they feel compelled to do work they do not enjoy, or if what they do enjoy is ignored as having no value or importance. In a society where slavery in the strict sense has been abolished, the social indications around work, the value of work, and the salary, have degraded many laborers into modern slaves – "wage slaves". 

2 People are considered laborers if their jobs have an adverse effect on them, yet they feel compelled to continue working by the necessity of conforming to societal expectations and earning the revenue to support themselves and their families. The polar opposite of labor is play. When we play a game, we enjoy what we are doing, but it is a purely private pastime; society does not care when or whether we play. 

3 Between labor and play stands work. People are labeled as workers if their personal interests coincide with the jobs society pays them to do; what is necessary labor from the point of view of society is voluntary play from the individual's personal point of view. Whether a job is to be designated as labor or work depends, not on the job itself, but on the tastes of the individual who undertakes it. The difference does not, for example, correlate with the difference between a manual and mental job or between jobs with low or high income; a gardener covered in dirt in a greenhouse may be a worker while a well-dressed city mayor may prove to be an unhappy laborer! 

4 Whether people are workers or laborers can be seen from their attitude toward leisure. To workers, leisure means simply the hours they need to relax and rest in order to work efficiently. Workers are therefore more likely to dedicate more time to working, taking too little leisure rather than too much. To laborers, on the other hand, leisure means autonomy from compulsion, so it is natural for them to imagine that the fewer hours they have to spend laboring, and the more hours they have free for play, the better. 

5 Besides the hours spent in leisure, workers and laborers differ in the amount of personal satisfaction they derive from their jobs. Workers who enjoy their jobs will be happier, less stressed, and generally more satisfied with their lives. They will also work with more diligence and precision because they have fostered a sense of personal pride in their jobs. On the other hand, laborers, whose sole incentive is earning their livelihood, feel that the time they spend on the daily grind is wasted and doesn't contribute to their happiness. Instead of valuing all 24 hours of their day as enjoyable and productive hours, they gauge only the time spent in leisure and play as meaningful. Laborers are commonplace in society, but still many people are in the lucky position of being workers. 

6 In recent decades, technological innovation and the division of labor have caused major economic changes by eliminating the need for special strengths or skills in many fields and have turned many paid occupations with enjoyable work into boring labor. Increasing productivity with automated machines, such as robots, has reduced the number of necessary laboring hours. It is possible to imagine an upcoming society in which the majority of the population will have almost as much leisure time as in earlier times was enjoyed by the medieval aristocracy. The medieval aristocrats had an abundance of leisure time but often wasted it in trivial pursuit of games and fashion. Likewise, modern day laborers with too much leisure time may find it difficult to refrain from the addictive and trivial pursuits of celebrity gossip, extravagant fashion, and excessive video games and TV – similar bad habits that waste valuable time. 

7 However, it's not necessary to take such a toxic attitude toward such a positive thing as leisure time. In fact, in many countries, people now use their leisure time to improve their minds and their working conditions to create a happier, more contented life. Lifelong learning can make the difference between being bored, unhappy laborers and workers who find meaning and joy in their employment and lives. "Continuing education" or "experiential learning" can offer an array of classes from pleasant diversions such as sports, art, or music, to leadership development or advanced accounting skills, to name but a few. 

8 All in all, people's attitude toward their work determines everything. Whatever the job, people who enjoy their work find time passes quickly. They hurl their passion into their work, be it physical like the work of a smith, or more mental like that of a scientist or an artist. Even purely mental work can suffice as an outlet, as aptly expressed by the phrase "sinking one's teeth into a problem". 

9 Eventually, everyone has to find a job and earn a living. Laborers are slaving away at a job they don't enjoy for a monetary reward, waiting all day until they go home and play. But while laborers are counting down the hours, workers are energized and focused, taking optimum pleasure in the task at hand. By choosing a job that is both useful to society and personally fulfilling, workers maintain a simultaneous sense of purpose and enthusiasm that improves their whole lives. So in the end, whatever job you choose, you must contend with this essential question: Will you be a laborer or a worker?

## No limit for China's astronauts in their space exploration endeavors

1 China's space exploration had reached a new milestone by 2021, when three astronauts of the _Shenzhou-12_ crew successfully docked at the _Tiangong_ space station, worked there for months, and then safely returned to the earth. The three – Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming, and Tang Hongbo – were selected rigorously from the current active, qualified Chinese astronauts. All these astronauts have been training for one of the most spectacular endeavors of China's space exploration: building and operating China's first space station. 

2 It was back in 1992 that China approved a blueprint for her manned space program and began training astronauts. The first batch of astronauts was chosen from veteran pilots in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force who had at least 600 flight hours in fighter jets or attack aircraft. More than 1,500 pilots applied, and after rounds of most demanding tests, the number reduced sharply to 14. In 1998, they became the founding members of the PLA Astronaut Group. 

3 On October 15, 2003, Yang Liwei became the first Chinese person to go into space in the Shenzhou-5 manned mission, making China the third country to send a man into space. During his 600,000 km expedition, Yang simultaneously displayed the Chinese and UN flags to hundreds of millions of Chinese who were witnessing his feat on television, and said, "Make use of outer space peacefully and for the benefit of all humankind." 

4 Since Yang's momentous journey, China has made a gigantic progress in space exploration, and more astronauts have been sent into orbit. The astronauts have performed scientific experiments and technological tests, undertaken extravehicular activities, and even delivered a science lecture watched by tens of millions of students. 

5 To achieve these accomplishments, though, the astronauts have endured countless rounds of training, tests, and drills, shedding sweat and owing an enormous debt to their families for their thorough understanding and continuous support. 

6 Once pilots are admitted to the astronaut team, they must immerse themselves in the study of about 60 subjects, including physics, astronautics, and astronomy. Normally, each of these subjects requires university students to take four-year courses, but the astronauts have just one year to complete their studies and must pass exams in every subject. 

7 During training, to simulate weightlessness, astronauts have to wear suits that weigh 160 kg and stay underwater for about four hours. They lose an average of 2 kg during each training session, and after a session they would be too exhausted to hold chopsticks. When conducting centrifuge training, astronauts must endure a force as much as eight times their own weight so that they will be able to resist the g-forces that severely restrict the ability to breathe during lift-off. None of the astronauts has pressed the emergency button to halt the program. 

8 The astronauts have also overcome hardships and difficulties during missions. Yang Liwei recalled that when _Shenzhou-5_ ascended toward the sky, a low-frequency oscillation made his internal organs vibrate violently, inflicting almost unbearable pain. He gritted his teeth and endured the pain because he was about to realize the nation's long-lasting dream of flying in space. During the Shenzhou-7 mission, Zhai Zhigang and Liu Boming discovered they were unable to open the spaceship's exit hatch. They decided to use a tool to force the hatch open despite the obvious safety risk. "We both knew what the other one was thinking at that very moment: We had to accomplish our mission and wave the Chinese flag in space, even though we realized that there would probably be no return trip for us," Zhai said. 

9 Looking back at their experiences, the astronauts thought their struggles, sacrifices, and persistence were all worthwhile. It is awe-inspiring and unforgettable for the astronauts to observe the earth and the universe from space. "I saw the lights of cities on earth and lightning ripping through the night sky. From our orbit, I saw the darkness and emptiness of space, and I wondered where the boundary is between the sky and the stars. I will never forget those scenes," said Liu Wang, who took part in the Shenzhou-9 mission. 

10 Jing Haipeng, who has taken part in several space missions, was awarded the August 1 Medal, the highest honor given to individual members of the Chinese PLA. Jing was both pleased and modest when he received the medal. For him, the honor and glory belong not only to the astronauts but also to tens of thousands of scientists, engineers, and workers who have played a role in the nation's manned space programs and contributed to sending the astronauts into space. 

11 The accomplishments of China's space exploration have become a source of pride and growing confidence in the nation, in addition to sparking patriotic sentiments in Chinese communities across the world. Wang Yaping, the female astronaut who delivered the science lecture from space, felt overwhelmed by the number of boys and girls who wrote to her upon her return. She had never imagined that her teaching could trigger off so many dreams and aspirations. Yang Liwei recalled that during a visit to New York, a Chinese-American held his hands and tearfully told him that the nation's achievements in space reflected the fact that "our motherland has risen", which gave Chinese people living overseas more courage and strength. 

12 The bravery, wisdom, and commitment the Chinese astronauts embody will definitely inspire numerous young people to join the lofty cause and set space as the stage to realize their ambitions and the dream of national rejuvenation. There is no limit to the vast universe or to China's space exploration endeavors.

## Surviving an economic crisis

1 The economic slump that so many people suffered through originated in the United States, with a regulatory failure of mortgages rated less risky than they turned out to be. As large numbers of homeowners proved unable to repay their loans, the companies that owned the loans (as well as their subsidiaries and shareholders) lost sizable amounts of money. The effects of these drastic losses soon spiraled into the U.S. job market as lay-offs and terminations. The rebound was slow in coming. Many people experienced long months of financial difficulties just like the character in this story. 

2 Facing tenant eviction after several months of unpaid rent, Sue Johnson packed up whatever she could fit into her two-door automobile and drove out of town. 

3 She wound up at a motel, putting down the $260 she had managed to scrape together from friends and from selling her living room set. It was all the money Sue had after her unemployment benefits had expired. She faced life as a migrant, a previously unimaginable situation for a woman who, not that long before, had held a corporate job in a metropolitan city and had been enrolled in a graduate business school. 

4 Sue knew that, in all likelihood, she would end up living in her car. She was part of a hard-luck group of jobless people who called themselves "99ers", because they had exhausted the maximum 99 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits that they could claim. 

5 Long-term unemployment was at record levels. Modest payments of unemployment benefits were a lifeline that enabled people who were out of work to maintain at least an appearance of normalcy, keeping a roof over their heads, putting gas in their cars, and paying electric and phone bills. 

6 Without the checks, people like Sue, who had once been a director of client services at a technology company, began to tumble over the economic cliff. The last remnants of their former working-class or middle-class lives were gone, and all of them faced unsure futures. 

7 When Sue received her last unemployment check, she felt a wave of profound grief. With no income to deposit, Sue's checking account went into a negative balance. Her car was on the verge of being repossessed. And, the constant harassment of the financing company for her car loan added to her daily stress. Each day, like a ping pong ball, Sue went back and forth between resolve and despair. 

8 It was a sickening plunge considering that only a short year and a half before, Sue had earned $56,000 a year at her old job, enjoyed vacationing in places like Mexico and the Caribbean, and started business school at an excellent university. 

9 Initially, Sue had tried to finish her university certification remotely, but finally dropped out because of the stress from her sinking finances. She applied for every possible job in the employment spectrum, from minimum-wage retail jobs to director positions. 

10 Sue should have been evicted from her two-bedroom apartment for non-payment several months before she was, but, thankfully, the process was delayed by paperwork and bureaucracy. Eventually, the bureaucracy caught up with her, and she was given 10 days to leave her apartment for good. She had no choice but to comply. 

11 That last day of her old life, Sue wept as she drove away. She wondered if she would ever again be able to reclaim that life of comfort and respect. She fell into complete despair and didn't know what would happen to her next. 

12 Friends came to her aid. One friend wired her $200 while she was driving away from her old apartment, enabling her to find refuge in a motel along the way. But Sue worried there wouldn't be any more charity that she desperately needed. 

13 Helped by gas cards donated by a church, Sue decided to return to her hometown. She figured the health-care safety net there was better, as well as the job market. She contacted a local shelter but learned there was a waiting list. Welfare was not an option, because she didn't have young children. And, Sue knew that none of her three adult sons were in a position to help her. 

14 "I knew the only help I was going to get was from me myself," Sue said. "I thought to myself: I have to take care of myself. I really, really need to get work. I need a job. I don't want to be seen as a parasite." 

15 Sue's motel room was depressing. Lining the shelves underneath the television were her food supplies: rice and noodles that she mixed with water in the motel's ice bucket and heated up in a microwave, peanut butter and jelly, a loaf of white bread – the subsistence of a desperate person. Sue's days were spent surfing Internet job indexes and applying for jobs where the silent "No", "No", "No" led to a feeling of helplessness. 

16 Sue had all new problems and obstacles to deal with, too, like what to do for an address for job applications. She worried about what would happen when her cell phone was cut off for non-payment, and calls to her number would disappear into an invisible world she could not reach. 

17 Finally, an old friend sent Sue a ray of hope, a small miracle: $300 cash – just enough for another brutal week of financial struggles.

With the rapid advancement of science and technology, the learning landscape is undergoing a subtle revolution. Students can now easily access a wealth of interdisciplinary information through the Internet, which has undoubtedly broadened their horizons. Furthermore, online education platforms provide a more flexible way of learning, allowing students to customize their learning according to their own pace and interests. The convergence of technology and education not only democratizes access to information but also transforms the learning experience itself. Virtual classrooms, multimedia resources, and interactive tools have become an important part of modern education. These technological advancements cater to diverse learning styles and make education more inclusive and effective. As we navigate this era of technological innovation, the synergy (协同作用) between science, technology, and learning continues to influence how we acquire and apply knowledge in an increasingly connected world.

Leonardo da Vinci, one of the greatest minds of the Italian Renaissance, is perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived. A painter, sculptor, architect, mathematician, engineer, and inventor, he is famous for a wide range of accomplishments. His natural genius, which crossed multiple disciplines, won him the title of "Renaissance Master". Leonardo is renowned primarily as a painter. Among his works, the _Mona Lisa_ is the best known and _The Last Supper_ the most reproduced religious painting of all time. What make Leonardo's drawings unique are mainly his innovative techniques and acute scientific mind. Perhaps only 15 of his paintings have survived, partly because his constant experimentation with new techniques made his total output quite small. Although not a prolific (多产的) painter, Leonardo was a most productive draftsman, keeping journals full of sketches, drawings, and diagrams. These notebooks, often referred to as da Vinci's manuscripts, recorded his inventions, observations, and theories about everything that captured his attention. Leonard's genius made him a pioneer in almost every field of study he undertook. His paintings, together with his notebooks, have contributed significantly to the history of art.

The English ceremony of afternoon tea dates back to the 1840s. The tradition evolved out of the rituals and routines that surrounded tea drinking in Britain before that time. Tea was first introduced to England in the late 1650s, but for a long time, it was only consumed by the royal family and the aristocracy due to its high cost. The habit of having afternoon tea did not become established until almost 200 years later. In those days, the British ate only two daily meals: a large breakfast late in the morning and a late dinner around 8 o'clock in the evening. Anna, the 7th Duchess of Bedford, can be credited for creating the tradition of afternoon tea to soothe hunger pangs before supper. She invited friends to join her for an additional afternoon meal at four to five o'clock. The menu included tea and snacks such as dainty cakes and sandwiches. Fine porcelain (瓷器) was used to serve this minor feast. Afternoon tea soon became popular, and is now a symbol of the elegant British way of life. As novelist Henry James wrote, "There are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea."

The WTO, established on January 1, 1995, intends to supervise and liberalize international trade. The organization deals with regulation of trade between members; it provides a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements, and a dispute resolution process aimed at enforcing participants' adherence (遵守) to WTO agreements, which are signed by representatives of members and ratified (批准) by their parliaments. The process of becoming a WTO member is unique to each applicant, and the terms of accession are dependent upon each applicant's stage of economic development and current trade regime (体制). China became a member of the WTO on December 11, 2001. The admission of China to the WTO was preceded by a lengthy process of negotiations and required significant changes to the Chinese economy. It also meant a deeper integration of China into the world economy. The admission of China to the WTO was an enormous multilateral (多边的) achievement which marked a clear commitment toward multilateralism from the Chinese perspective.
